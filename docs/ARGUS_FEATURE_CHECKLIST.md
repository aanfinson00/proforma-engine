# Argus Enterprise Feature Checklist

A cross-source synthesis of Argus Enterprise capabilities, used as the roadmap target for OpenVal.

## Methodology

Compiled from four parallel research passes (May 2026):

1. **Altus XML Integration Schema** (Scribd AE 11.0.5, Yumpu 9.1) — schema-driven feature catalog. Anything modelable in Argus appears as an XML element.
2. **Competitor comparison tables & integration docs** (Rockport VAL, Forbury, Apers, Lightbox CashFlow, Assess+RE, PropertyMetrics, SoftwareFinder, Altus marketing). Features that Argus competitors call out by name.
3. **Training curricula + job postings + practitioner community** (Altus 2-Day, Cert Prep, eLearning, NAIOP ASC, ICSC, UCLA Extension, 40+ job postings, WSO/ACG/Realogic). Real-world frequency.
4. **YouTube tutorial titles** scraped via `yt-dlp --flat-playlist` from 14 channels (253 raw titles, 162 unique). Surfaces what practitioners actually search for.

Triangulation: features mentioned by 3+ sources are **CORE** (table-stakes for any serious Argus alternative); 2 sources = **STD**; 1 source = **LONG-TAIL**.

## OpenVal coverage today

- ✅ **Done** (Phase 1, v0.1.0): lease model, cashflow projector, NNN/MG/FSG recoveries, debt amortization (IO + balloon), reversion (trailing-12 NOI / cap), unlevered + levered IRR, equity multiple, rent step-ups, free rent, TI/LC
- 🟡 **Partial**: percentage rent (data model only, no projector yet); recovery cap (annual only)
- ❌ **Gaps**: ~50 CORE features and ~80 STD/LONG-TAIL features. Top priorities laid out below.

## Roadmap impact

**Phase 2 priorities** (closes the gap to "serious Argus alternative"):
1. **Market Leasing Assumptions on rollover** — Argus's signature differentiator vs Excel. Every source ranked this #2-#3.
2. **Forward NOI for reversion** — Argus convention (year N+1 / cap), not trailing-12. Currently a known accuracy gap.
3. **Vacancy & credit loss** — general vacancy, absorption & turnover vacancy, gross-up checkbox.
4. **CSV/Excel rent roll import** — adoption blocker; nobody types in 200 leases by hand.
5. **`.aeex` / `.aeix` import** — Argus's XML export format is public; parsing is tolerated (Forbury/Lightbox/Assess+RE all do it).
6. **Sensitivity matrix** — IRR matrix on yield / growth / cap rate. Built-in feature competitors all replicate.

**Phase 3+** (parity push):
- Equity waterfalls (GP/LP, preferred return, promote tiers) — Argus itself offloads to ARGUS Taliance, most practitioners do this in Excel anyway
- Partition reports
- Portfolio rollup
- Audit log / model versioning
- Scenario manager
- Inflation overrides per category

## What's NOT in Argus (wedge opportunities for OpenVal)

- **Full equity waterfall in the same tool** (Argus offloads to Taliance). Apers explicitly flags this as a gap. Building it native to OpenVal is a real differentiator.
- **Multi-tranche debt sizing** with sensitivity (Apers note). Stretch.
- **LIHTC / tax credit / opportunity zone / 1031** modeling (Apers note). Stretch.
- **Programmatic API for end-to-end underwriting automation** — Argus's API is partner-focused, not end-customer scriptable. OpenVal is Python-first, so this is built-in.

## Strategic context

As of 2026, **Argus Enterprise is being sunset as a standalone product** — Altus is migrating subscribers to ARGUS Intelligence Platform. This creates churn risk for Altus and adoption opportunity for alternatives.
